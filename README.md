# Predictive-Analysis-of-Car-Pricing

# Overview
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of various regression models to predict the prices of automobiles. The dataset encompasses a range of features such as car make, number of doors, engine size, horsepower, etc., which are essential for the price prediction.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Techniques like mean or median imputation are used to handle missing data points, ensuring the dataset's integrity for analysis.
- **Categorical to Numeric Transformation**: Categorical variables are encoded to numeric to make them compatible for model input.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scaling methods are applied to normalize data features, improving model training efficiency and effectiveness.

## Model Development and Evaluation
- **Regression Models**: Models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Regression are implemented and assessed.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is quantified using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
- **Visualization**: Model performances are visualized through bar graphs for easy comparison and interpretation.

## Feature Selection and Model Validation
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: This method is used to identify the most significant features that influence car prices.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implemented to ensure the model's robustness and reliability across different data subsets.

## Objective
The goal is to create a reliable and precise model that can predict car prices, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.
